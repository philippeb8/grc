In each directory with galaxy name, data files include:

mlcat.dat
 1st line: Galaxy name (0 means none)
 2nd line and after:
   1st column: R [kpc]
   2nd column: SB=mu [Lsun/sqpc] w-band corrected for inclination 
   3rd column: SMD-F [Msun/sqpc] 
   4th column: SMD-S [Msun/sqpc] 
   5th column: ML-F [Lsun/Msun]  ibid
   6th column: ML-S [Lsun/Msun]  ibid
   7th column: Vrot [km/s]
   8th column: R/h (h=scale radius)

rc.dat
   1st column: R [kpc]
   2nd column: Vrot [km/s]
